## 1. Description & Key Features

**Trackscendence** is a full-stack, secure, and highly performant web application built from scratch to deliver a seamless online multiplayer gaming experience. The platform synchronizes game sessions, handles real-time peer interactions, and ensures robust account security.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Live multiplayer matching and an advanced UNO game engine logic via WebSockets.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth, anonymous guest login, and 2FA support.
- **User Ecosystem**: Customizable user profiles, statistics, peer friendships, and relationship status tracking.
- **Live Interaction**: Real-time messaging, chat lobbies, and secure WebSocket authentication.
- **Tournaments & Live Brackets**: Single-elimination bracket manager, creator-controlled starts, real-time match staging, and live bracket visualization/alerts.

---

## 2. UNO Game Rules

Our multiplayer engine implements the classic rules of UNO:

- **Players & Age**: Supports **2 to 6 players**, recommended for ages 7+.
- **Setup**: Every player is dealt **7 cards** face down. Remaining cards form the _Draw Pile_. The top card is flipped face up to form the _Discard Pile_.
- **Gameplay**:
  - The player to the left of the dealer starts.
  - Players must match the top card of the Discard Pile by **Color, Number, or Action/Symbol**.
  - **Wild Cards** can be played at any time, allowing the player to select the active color.
  - If a player has no matches (or chooses not to play), they must **draw one card** from the Draw Pile.
  - If the first card flipped from the Draw Pile is an Action card, its effect applies to the first player.
- **Yelling "UNO!"**: When a player has exactly **1 card** remaining, they must yell **"UNO!"**. If caught by another player before the next turn begins, they must draw 2 penalty cards.
- **Winning**: The first player to discard all of their cards wins the game.
- **Reshuffling**: If the Draw Pile is exhausted, the Discard Pile is reshuffled (leaving the top card) to rebuild the Draw Pile.

### 2.1 User Tournaments & Live Brackets

Trackscendence features a built-in single-elimination tournament management system that allows users to compete in structured multiplayer brackets:

- **Bracket Creation & Join**: Any player can create a tournament from the lobby. Other active players can discover and join the tournament roster.
- **Roster & Join Alerts**: When a player joins, the tournament creator is instantly notified via real-time social alerts, and the updated roster/bracket is synchronized to all registered participants.
- **Automated Match Staging**: Once the creator starts the tournament, the bracket engine automatically schedules and pairs players. It terminates any previous open rooms/seats they held and scaffolds dedicated game rooms (e.g., `Tournament Name — R[round] M[slot]`) for each active match.
- **Real-Time Match Alerts**: When a match in the bracket becomes ready, players receive a high-priority Socket.IO alert (`tournament:match_ready`) that deep-links and redirects them directly to the active game board.
- **Dynamic Bracket Advancement**: Upon match completion, the winner automatically advances to the next tier of the single-elimination bracket, which updates in real-time for all spectators and players.

---

## 3. Security & Authentication

Our platform enforces robust security mechanisms to protect user accounts and game history:

- **Password Policies**: Strong password strength validation and secure authenticated password change procedures.
- **Password Reset**: Expiring password reset tokens delivered securely via Mailpit or configured SMTP server.
- **Identifier Login**: The standard login form accepts either the account email address or username, normalizes the identifier, and sends the same generic failure message for invalid credentials.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: TOTP-based 2FA with backup recovery codes. Managed directly via the authenticated User Settings page.
- **Account Protection**: Automated failed login lockout thresholds and session security features.
- **42 OAuth Login**: "Continue with 42" signs users in through the 42 intra (authorization-code flow, `public` scope). A first login provisions an account from the intra profile; an intra email that matches an existing account links the 42 identity to it instead, still gated by 2FA when enabled. The server exchanges the code, issues the platform's own JWT, and never stores intra tokens.

42 login is optional per environment: set `FORTYTWO_CLIENT_ID`, `FORTYTWO_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `FORTYTWO_REDIRECT_URI` (see `.env.example`) and register the redirect URI on the intra application. The login button enables itself wherever the server reports credentials via `GET /api/v1/auth/providers`; without them it stays a disabled "Soon" placeholder.

## 4. System & Database Architecture

### High-Level Overview

At the highest level, Trackscendence is a single-page React client talking to one
Express backend that owns both the REST API and the real-time WebSocket layer,
backed by a single PostgreSQL database and a couple of external services:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  player([Player])

  subgraph frontend[Frontend · React + Vite]
    ui[UI + Zustand stores]
  end

  subgraph backend[Backend · Express + Socket.IO]
    rest[REST API]
    ws[WebSocket layer]
    engine[UNO game engine]
  end

  db[(PostgreSQL · Prisma)]
  external[[42 OAuth · Mailpit / SMTP]]

  player <--> ui
  ui -->|HTTP /api/v1| rest
  ui <-->|WebSocket| ws
  ws --> engine
  rest --> db
  ws --> db
  rest --> external
```

Requests hit the REST API for stateless work (auth, profiles, leaderboard) while
live gameplay and chat flow over WebSockets. Active game engines live in memory
and are flushed to PostgreSQL once a match ends. For the full topology, backend
layering, and realtime flow diagrams, see
**[System Architecture](docs/architecture.md)**.

### System Architecture

The platform is orchestrated using Docker Compose, decoupling services into distinct containers managed under a shared virtual network:

- **Nginx (Reverse Proxy)**: Acts as the single entry point on port `8080`, routing traffic to the frontend or API gateway.
- **Frontend (Client)**: A React SPA served via Vite in development, and built/served through Nginx in production.
- **Backend (Server)**: An Express API handling REST endpoints and real-time state synchronization via Socket.IO.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database managed through Prisma ORM migrations.

```mermaid

  browser([Browser])

  subgraph compose[Docker Compose network]
    nginx[Nginx reverse proxy · :8080]
    client[Client · React + Vite]
    server[Server · Express + Socket.IO · :3001]
    db[(PostgreSQL)]
  end

  oauth[[42 OAuth]]

  browser --> nginx
  nginx -->|static assets| client
  nginx -->|/api/v1 · /websocket| server
  server --> db
  server --> mail
  server --> oauth
```

### Request Lifecycle

Every REST call flows through the same layered path, so responsibilities stay separated: controllers only read the request, services hold the business logic, and repositories own all Prisma access. Typed exceptions bubble up to a single error handler that converts them into `{ error: { code, message } }`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  req([HTTP request]) --> app[app.js]
  app --> routes[routes/v1]
  routes --> mw[Auth middleware<br/>requireAuth · requireRole]
  mw --> controller[Controller<br/>parse & validate]
  controller --> service[Service<br/>business logic]
  service --> repo[Repository<br/>Prisma queries]
  repo --> pg[(PostgreSQL)]
  service -. throws .-> exc[Typed exception]
  exc --> handler[errorHandler]
  handler --> res([JSON error response])
```

### Realtime Game Flow

Live gameplay runs over Socket.IO. On connection the server asks the client for its JWT within a five-second window, then holds each active match in an in-memory store that behaves like an async cache, so it can later be swapped for Redis without touching callers. A finished match is flushed to PostgreSQL once, at game over.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant WS as Socket.IO layer
  participant G as In-memory game store
  participant DB as PostgreSQL

  C->>WS: connect, then send JWT (5s handshake)
  WS-->>C: authenticated
  C->>WS: play move
  WS->>G: apply move to game engine
  G-->>WS: next game state
  WS-->>C: broadcast state to seated players
  Note over G,DB: on game over
  G->>DB: persist completed game (game.repository)
```

### Database Schema

Our database relational schema is defined in Prisma and is automatically kept up-to-date. You can view the live entity-relationship diagram here:

_Note: Regenerate the ERD diagram inside the `/docs` folder with `npm run docs:erd --prefix server`._

## 6. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or Docker Engine
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) & npm (if running locally without Docker)

### Installation & Configuration

1. **Clone the repository**

   The code is hosted in two places with an identical tree, so every step below is the same whichever one you clone from.

   From GitHub (development):

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Trackscendence/trackscendence.git
   cd trackscendence
   ```

   From the 42 Vogsphere (evaluation) — use the SSH URL the intra shows for this project, then enter the folder it creates:

   ```bash
   git clone git@vogsphere.42london.com:vogsphere/<your-project-repo>
   cd <your-project-repo>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```
   This installs the root, `server/`, and `client/` packages in one step (it runs `npm install` in each). The root install is also what wires up the Git pre-commit hooks. Running the app in Docker installs dependencies inside the containers as well, but you still need the root install locally for the hooks; the no-Docker path below needs all three.
3. **Setup Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   > **Note:** The `.env.example` file is heavily documented inline. Review it to understand port configurations, database credentials, and security keys. Make sure ports `3001` (Backend API), `5173` (Frontend), and `5432` (PostgreSQL) are free on your host machine. At minimum, set a real `JWT_SECRET` (and `TWO_FACTOR_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`) before starting — the server refuses to boot without `JWT_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL`. Generate one with:
   >
   > ```bash
   > node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   > ```

### Execution

We use Docker to guarantee environment parity across development and production deployments.

**Development Mode (Hot-reloading enabled):**

```bash
npm run compose:dev
```

- Frontend Application: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3001`

**Production Mode (Nginx Reverse Proxy):**

```bash
npm run compose:up
```

- Consolidated Web Application: `https://localhost:8443`

The production stack terminates HTTPS in nginx with a self-signed certificate
generated at container start, so browser-to-backend traffic (including the
websocket, which upgrades to `wss://`) is encrypted. The first visit shows a
one-time "your connection is not private" warning; accept it to proceed, which
is expected for a locally-run project. Plain `http://localhost:8080` redirects
to the HTTPS origin. Set `CLIENT_HTTPS_PORT` in `.env` to change the port.

**Local Mode (no Docker):**

Running without Docker means you supply the PostgreSQL database yourself and run
the migrations by hand (only the Docker stack applies them automatically at
startup). Assuming you already ran `npm run install:all` and `cp .env.example .env`:

1. **Have a PostgreSQL server running** and create a role and database that match
   the `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` values in your `.env`.
   With the defaults from `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   createuser trackscendence --pwprompt   # enter the POSTGRES_PASSWORD (default: changeme)
   createdb trackscendence -O trackscendence
   ```

2. **Point `DATABASE_URL` at your local database.** The example value uses the
   Docker network hostname `database`, which does not resolve outside Compose.
   For a local Postgres, change the host to `localhost`:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://trackscendence:changeme@localhost:5432/trackscendence
   ```

3. **Create the schema and generate the Prisma client.** These run against your
   local database (unlike the root `prisma:*` scripts, which exec into the Docker
   container), so invoke them with the `server` prefix:

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate --prefix server    # applies migrations, creates the tables
   npm run prisma:generate --prefix server   # regenerates the Prisma client
   ```

4. **(Optional) Seed sample data** — demo users, games, and social data:

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:seed --prefix server
   ```

5. **Start both apps together:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The browser talks only to the Vite origin (`http://localhost:5173`); API and
websocket traffic is proxied to the backend, which the `dev` script assumes is on
`http://localhost:3001`. If your backend runs elsewhere, set
`VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET` accordingly.
